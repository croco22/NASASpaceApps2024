5. UPDATE NOTES
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Lab-wide notes:

2011-10-07

We introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA or Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR)
University of Colorado Boulder that made the measurement.  We can 
now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace gas species 
in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases group (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species group (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

Project-specific notes:

2022-07-21

Dataset is now provided in self describing ObsPack format with improved metadata.
Surface flask event data are available in NetCDF and ASCII text. Surface flask
monthly data are available in ASCII text. Shipboard data binned by 5 or 3 degrees
are now removed from surface flask event data, but still provided in monthly data.
This format change makes some previous notes irrelevant.

Parameter-specific notes:

2023-05-01

In Spring 2023, we moved to an internal quality control
(QC) tagging system for the flask air samples.
There are three categories of tags documenting
issues associated with sample collection, measurement
and representativity in the CCGG database.
Tags are more specific than flags, which allows
a more granular internal tracking and analysis of QC issues.

Tags are converted to simplified 3 character flags in the data
files for external data users.  See section 7.5 for more details.

2018-07-30

Uncertainties recalculated after reassessment of
uncertainty terms. Uncertainties on early data are
now larger than before.

2015-07-07

We updated and extended the WMO CH4 X2004 scale to X2004A.
Details are described on a dedicated web page: 
http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/ch4_scale.html. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

All samples were analyzed for methane at NOAA GML in Boulder, Colorado
by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection or by cavity ring-
down spectroscopy (since August, 2019), and each sample aliquot was 
referenced to the NOAA 2004A methane standard scale
(see www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/ch4_scale.html; Dlugokencky et al., 2005).
Measurements are reported in units of nanomol/mol (10^-9 mol CH4 per mol
of dry air (nmol/mol) or parts per billion (ppb))

For measurements using gas chromatography measurements, aliquots of sample
and standard gas are injected into a gas chromatograph (GC) alternatively 
with a sampling valve.  Methane (CH4) is separated from other sample 
constituents using packed columns and detected using flame ionization (FID).
This process is highly automated for field and laboratory operations.
Through most of the period 1983-1991, one flask of a sample pair was analyzed
for methane, and, whenever the overpressure was sufficient, at least two 
aliquots were analyzed. We have used the difference in methane mole fraction 
between the first and second aliquot to establish the repeatability of the 
measurement. The average repeatability has been approximately 3 ppb before 1991.  
In October 1991, our analysis procedure was altered; we began analyzing a single
aliquot from both members of the flask pair. The principle reasons for the change
were to simplify flask handling procedures (the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide
projects also measure both flasks of the sample pair) and to have flask pair 
agreement (the difference in methane mole fraction between the two flasks collected 
simultaneously) as an additional diagnostic to use in evaluating the quality 
of the data.  The repeatability of the analytical instrument is now assessed 
by two approaches: approximately monthly measurements of target tanks, and 
assessing the relative stability of the standard or reference gas aliquots 
during each day of flask measurements.  (See Steele et al., 1987, Lang et 
al., 1990a,b, Dlugokencky et al., 1994b, and Dlugokencky et al., 2005 for 
details of the sampling network, equipment, standards, and procedures.)
Repeatability after 1991 has ranged from 1 to 2 ppb over the period of our GC
measurements.

In August, 2019, we switched from GC/FID to a Cavity Ring-Down 
Spectrometer that analyzes CH4 and CO2. The analyzer is calibrated 
off-line with a suite of standards once per month relative to a 
dry, natural reference air in a high-pressure cylinder. All air 
samples are measured relative to the same reference, and CH4 and CO2 
values in measured samples are calculated based on their ratio to 
the reference.  Repeatability of the analyzer, based on repeated 
analysis of air from a high-pressure cylinder, is ~0.2 ppb (1 sigma). 



-------------------------------------------------------------------
7. DATA - GENERAL COMMENTS

Uncertainties of the CH4 measurements are included.
Key components of it are our ability to propagate the WMO XCH4
scale to working standards, the repeatability of the analyzers
used for sample measurement, and the long-term variability of 
the analyzer responses (reproducibility). The scale propagation 
uncertainty is estimated to be 0.2 ppb, based on the reproducibility 
determined for scale propagation in our calibration laboratory.
Long-term reproducibility is estimated to be +/- 0.5 ppb based on 
repeated measurements of air from a high-pressure cylinder, or
the long-term variability in the differences between measurements 
of test flasks on the sample analysis system and separate 
measurements of the test gas used to fill the test flasks. The
three terms are added in quadrature (square root of the sum of the
squares) to estimate the measurement uncertainty at 68% confidence
interval.  

Pacific Ocean Cruise (POC, travelling between the US west coast
and New Zealand or Australia) flask-air samples were collected in
about 5 degree latitude intervals. For South China Sea (SCS), samples
 were collected at about 3 degree latitude intervals.

Sampling intervals are approximately weekly for fixed sites
and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for POC and
about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.

Historically, samples have been collected using two general methods:
flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump, or opening a
stopcock on an evacuated glass flask; since 28 April 2003, only the
former method is used.  During each sampling event, a pair of flasks
is filled.

7.3 DATA - FILE TYPE

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements
in two unique file formats; netCDF and ASCII text. 

The Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text (technically UTF-8 encoded) file is derived directly from the 
netCDF file.  The text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using 
any ASCII or UTF-8 capable text editor.  "Self-describing" means the file 
includes enough information about the included data (called metadata) 
that no additional file is required to understand the structure of the data 
and how to read and use the data.  Note that some non-ASCII characters (accents,
international character sets) may be present in various names and contact

7.4 DATA - CONTENT


See individual files for description of the provided variables and other
dataset metadata.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

Quality control 3-column flags indicate retained and rejected flask
results as follows in datafiles.

If the first character is not a period, the sample result should be
rejected for scientific use due to sample collection and/or measurement
issue. A second column character other than a period indicates a sample
that is likely valid but does not meet selection for representativeness
such as midday sampling or background air sampling. A third column flag
other than a period indicates abnormal circumstances that are not thought
to affect the data quality.

                Flag    Description

Retained        ...     good pair, no other issues

Rejected        M..     sample measurement issue
                C..     sample collection issue
                B..     both measurement and collection issues

Selection       .S.     selection issue. High/low mole fraction
                        thought to not represent background
                        conditions for example.

Informational   ..M     informational measurement tag or
                        potential measurement issue
                ..C     informational collection tag or
                        potential collection issue

    The retained values comprise the data set that mostly represents
CH4 distribution in the remote, well-mixed global surface atmosphere.
Data with selection flag (with a 2nd column flag other than '.') are
likely valid measurements, but represent poorly mixed air parcels
influenced by local sources. Data selection is applied considering
multiple measured gases from the same air sample , and sample
conditions such as wind direction, wind speed, and back trajectory,
in addition to identifying outliers using a curve fitting approach
described in detail here:
https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/mbl/crvfit/crvfit.html

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.6 COLLECTION METHODS

A single-character code is used to identify the sample collection method.
The codes are:

    P - Sample collected using a portable, battery
 powered pumping unit.  Two flasks are
 connected in series, flushed with air, and then
 pressurized to 1.2 - 1.5 times ambient pressure.
    D - Similar to P but the air passes through a
 condenser cooled to about 5 deg C to partially
  dry the sample.
    G - Similar to D but with a gold-plated condenser.
    T - Evacuated flask filled by opening an O-ring sealed       
 stopcock.
    S - Flasks filled at NOAA GML observatories by sampling
 air from the in situ CO2 measurement air intake system.
    N - Before 1981, flasks filled using a hand-held
 aspirator bulb. After 1981, flasks filled using a
 pump different from those used in method P, D, or G.
    F - Five liter evacuated flasks filled by opening a
 ground glass, greased stopcock

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.7 DATA - MONTHLY AVERAGES

The monthly data files in https://gml.noaa.gov/aftp/data/trace_gases/ch4/flask/surface/ 
use the following naming scheme (see Section 7.2):

     [parameter]_[site]_[project]_[lab ID number]_[measurement group]_month.txt

(ex) CH4_pocn30_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CH4 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected on the Pacific
     Ocean Cruise sampling platform and grouped at 30N +/- 2.5 degrees.

(ex) CO2_brw_surface-flask_1_ccgg_month.txt contains CO2 ccgg monthly
     mean values for all surface flask samples collected at Barrow, Alaska.

Monthly means are produced for each site by first averaging all
valid measurement results in the event file with a unique sample
date and time.  Values are then extracted at weekly intervals from 
a smooth curve (Thoning et al., 1989) fitted to the averaged data 
and these weekly values are averaged for each month to give the 
monthly means recorded in the files.  Flagged data are excluded from the
curve fitting process.  Some sites are excluded from the monthly
mean directory because sparse data or a short record does not allow a
reasonable curve fit.  Also, if there are 3 or more consecutive months
without data, monthly means are not calculated for these months.

The data files contain multiple lines of header information 
followed by one line for each available month.

Fields are defined as follows:

Field 1:    [SITE CODE] The three-character sampling location code (see above).

Field 2:    [YEAR] The sample collection year and month.
Field 3:    [MONTH]

Field 4:    [MEAN VALUE] Computed monthly mean value
